# My First Blog Website
Welcome to my first blog website! This project was built from scratch using React.js. While it may not have all the bells and whistles, it represents my journey as a developer. Let's dive into the details and reminisce about the good old days! 📝🚀

## Overview
This blog website was my initial attempt at creating a platform to share my thoughts and experiences. Here's what it currently offers:
1. **Static Routes**: I've set up basic routes for different pages (e.g., home, about, contact).
2. **UI Basics**: The user interface is simple and functional. It's a testament to my early design skills.
3. **Theme toggling**: You can change between light theme and dark theme.

## Features to Be Updated
1. **Dynamic Routes**: Enhance the website by adding dynamic routes for individual blog posts. Each post will have its own URL.
2. **Content Management System (CMS)**: Integrate a CMS to make it easier to create, edit, and manage blog content. No more manual HTML updates!
3. **UI Overhaul**: The current design is minimalistic. Give it a fresh coat of paint, add some styling, and make it more visually appealing.
4. **Responsive**: Make the application responsive for small devices.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js**: My trusty frontend library with the `context api`.
- **Static Routes**: Basic routing for different pages.
